          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>Tbilisi Tectonics is a team of space geologists and web developers who have created a live earthquake map and seismic zone map to help people stay informed about earthquake risk. Our goal is to provide easy-to-access and up-to-date information about earthquakes so that people can make informed decisions about their safety.</p>
